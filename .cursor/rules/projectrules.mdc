## Design Pattern: ---

## Visual Style

### Color Palette:
- Primary background: #22242A (deep charcoal, main workspace and sidebar)
- Secondary backgrounds: #282A30, #24262C (subtle card and panel distinctions)
- Accent colors: 
  - Yellow: #F6D365 (used for status tags and highlights)
  - Green: #4ADE80 (task progress, labels)
  - Blue: #60A5FA (status indicators, toggles)
  - Pink: #F472B6 (avatars, minor accents)
- Text: 
  - Primary: #F3F4F6 (off-white, high contrast)
  - Secondary: #A1A1AA (muted gray, secondary info)
  - Disabled: #6B7280 (low emphasis/disabled states)
- Borders and separators: #303136 (very subtle, low-contrast lines)
- Status/priority: 
  - High: #F87171 (red)
  - Medium: #FBBF24 (amber)
  - Low: #6EE7B7 (mint green)

### Typography & Layout:
- Font Family: Inter, sans-serif (modern, geometric, highly legible)
- Font Weights: 400 (regular) for body, 600-700 (semibold/bold) for headings and key labels
- Hierarchy: 
  - Large bold titles for main sections (e.g., project name)
  - Medium weight for list items and card titles
  - Smaller, regular weight for secondary info (dates, labels)
- Layout: 
  - 3-column Kanban grid for main content
  - Vertical sidebar navigation, fixed to the left
  - Consistent padding (20-32px in main areas), generous spacing between cards (16px)
  - Rounded corners (10-16px radius) on cards and interactive elements
  - Center-aligned icons and vertical rhythm maintained via equalized margins

### Key Design Elements
#### Card Design:
- Surface: Elevated cards with soft drop shadows (#1A1B20, low opacity) and subtle, smooth gradients for depth
- Borders: Minimal, if any; separation via shadow and color layering
- Hover States: Slightly lighter background shade, intensified shadow, subtle scaling (1.02x) on hover
- Hierarchy: Clear separation of card header (title, status badges), main content, and footer (avatars, actions)

#### Navigation:
- Sidebar: Vertical, dark, collapsible with grouped sections and clear iconography
- Active State: Accent color bar (e.g., #F6D365 yellow) and bold text highlight, subtle background shift
- Collapsible Groups: Chevron icons indicate expand/collapse, smooth animation for group transitions
- Top Bar: Minimal, with key action buttons and breadcrumbs

#### Data Visualization:
- Status Indicators: Pill-shaped badges with color-coding (green, amber, red) for task status/priority
- Progress Bars: Flat, thin, rounded ends, using accent green
- Minimal use of charts—focus on task and status visualization via tags and progress indicators

#### Interactive Elements:
- Buttons: Rounded, ghost or solid styles; primary actions in accent colors, secondary in muted gray
- Form Fields: Rounded, filled backgrounds, soft focus ring (#60A5FA blue glow), clear label and placeholder text
- Toggles/Switches: Rounded, blue-accent active state, subtle shadow
- Micro-interactions: Smooth transitions for hovers, button presses, and card movements (drag & drop)

### Design Philosophy
This interface embodies:
- A modern, minimalist, and professional aesthetic with a focus on clarity and hierarchy
- Dark mode-first design for reduced eye strain and a sleek, tech-forward look
- Friendly, rounded components to convey approachability while maintaining enterprise-grade polish
- Consistent use of color to signal status and guide user attention without visual clutter
- User experience goals: quick comprehension, efficient navigation, and delightful micro-interactions for productivity-focused users
- Visual strategy: balance between functional density and breathing room, ensuring users feel empowered, not overwhelmed

---" design pattern.
Ensure all implementations align with this pattern's best practices.

## Tech Stack Requirements

- **Framework:** React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool:** Vite with SWC plugin
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v3 with CSS custom properties
- **UI Components:** Shadcn/ui with Radix UI primitives
- **Animations:** Motion library (NOT framer-motion)
- **Icons:** Lucide React
- **State Management:** TanStack React Query
- **Forms:** React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **HTTP Client:** Axios
- **Notifications:** Sonner

## Critical Setup Rules

1. **ALWAYS run `npm install` before any build commands**
2. Use Motion library for animations, NOT framer-motion
3. Import Inter font in index.css
4. Use Tailwind v3 with tailwind.config.js (not CSS-based config)
5. Use `@/` path aliases for imports
6. Use Shadcn components instead of custom UI components

## Code Style

- Write concise, technical TypeScript code
- Use functional and declarative patterns (avoid classes)
- Favor iteration and modularization over duplication
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (isLoading, hasError)
- Structure: exported components, subcomponents, helpers, types
- Minimize `useEffect` and `useState`; favor React Server Components where possible

## API Layer Pattern

- Centralize API calls in `src/api/` directory
- Use Axios with interceptors for auth and error handling
- Create React Query hooks in `src/hooks/`
- Implement proper error handling with toast notifications
- Use TypeScript types for all API responses

# Modern Design Best Practices

## Philosophy

Create unique, memorable experiences while maintaining consistency through modern design principles. Every project should feel distinct yet professional, innovative yet intuitive.

---

## Landing Pages & Marketing Sites

### Hero Sections
**Go beyond static backgrounds:**
- Animated gradients with subtle movement
- Particle systems or geometric shapes floating
- Interactive canvas backgrounds (Three.js, WebGL)
- Video backgrounds with proper fallbacks
- Parallax scrolling effects
- Gradient mesh animations
- Morphing blob animations


### Layout Patterns
**Use modern grid systems:**
- Bento grids (asymmetric card layouts)
- Masonry layouts for varied content
- Feature sections with diagonal cuts or curves
- Overlapping elements with proper z-index
- Split-screen designs with scroll-triggered reveals

**Avoid:** Traditional 3-column equal grids

### Scroll Animations
**Engage users as they scroll:**
- Fade-in and slide-up animations for sections
- Scroll-triggered parallax effects
- Progress indicators for long pages
- Sticky elements that transform on scroll
- Horizontal scroll sections for portfolios
- Text reveal animations (word by word, letter by letter)
- Number counters animating into view

**Avoid:** Static pages with no scroll interaction

### Call-to-Action Areas
**Make CTAs impossible to miss:**
- Gradient buttons with hover effects
- Floating action buttons with micro-interactions
- Animated borders or glowing effects
- Scale/lift on hover
- Interactive elements that respond to mouse position
- Pulsing indicators for primary actions

---

## Dashboard Applications

### Layout Structure
**Always use collapsible side navigation:**
- Sidebar that can collapse to icons only
- Smooth transition animations between states
- Persistent navigation state (remember user preference)
- Mobile: drawer that slides in/out
- Desktop: sidebar with expand/collapse toggle
- Icons visible even when collapsed

**Structure:**
```
/dashboard (layout wrapper with sidebar)
  /dashboard/overview
  /dashboard/analytics
  /dashboard/settings
  /dashboard/users
  /dashboard/projects
```

All dashboard pages should be nested inside the dashboard layout, not separate routes.

### Data Tables
**Modern table design:**
- Sticky headers on scroll
- Row hover states with subtle elevation
- Sortable columns with clear indicators
- Pagination with items-per-page control
- Search/filter with instant feedback
- Selection checkboxes with bulk actions
- Responsive: cards on mobile, table on desktop
- Loading skeletons, not spinners
- Empty states with illustrations or helpful text

**Use modern table libraries:**
- TanStack Table (React Table v8)
- AG Grid for complex data
- Data Grid from MUI (if using MUI)

### Charts & Visualizations
**Use the latest charting libraries:**
- Recharts (for React, simple charts)
- Chart.js v4 (versatile, well-maintained)
- Apache ECharts (advanced, interactive)
- D3.js (custom, complex visualizations)
- Tremor (for dashboards, built on Recharts)

**Chart best practices:**
- Animated transitions when data changes
- Interactive tooltips with detailed info
- Responsive sizing
- Color scheme matching design system
- Legend placement that doesn't obstruct data
- Loading states while fetching data

### Dashboard Cards
**Metric cards should stand out:**
- Gradient backgrounds or colored accents
- Trend indicators (↑ ↓ with color coding)
- Sparkline charts for historical data
- Hover effects revealing more detail
- Icon representing the metric
- Comparison to previous period

---

## Color & Visual Design

### Color Palettes
**Create depth with gradients:**
- Primary gradient (not just solid primary color)
- Subtle background gradients
- Gradient text for headings
- Gradient borders on cards
- Elevated surfaces for depth

**Color usage:**
- 60-30-10 rule (dominant, secondary, accent)
- Consistent semantic colors (success, warning, error)
- Accessible contrast ratios (WCAG AA minimum)

### Typography
**Create hierarchy through contrast:**
- Large, bold headings (48-72px for heroes)
- Clear size differences between levels
- Variable font weights (300, 400, 600, 700)
- Letter spacing for small caps
- Line height 1.5-1.7 for body text
- Inter, Poppins, or DM Sans for modern feel

### Shadows & Depth
**Layer UI elements:**
- Multi-layer shadows for realistic depth
- Colored shadows matching element color
- Elevated states on hover
- Neumorphism for special elements (sparingly)

---

## Interactions & Micro-animations

### Button Interactions
**Every button should react:**
- Scale slightly on hover (1.02-1.05)
- Lift with shadow on hover
- Ripple effect on click
- Loading state with spinner or progress
- Disabled state clearly visible
- Success state with checkmark animation

### Card Interactions
**Make cards feel alive:**
- Lift on hover with increased shadow
- Subtle border glow on hover
- Tilt effect following mouse (3D transform)
- Smooth transitions (200-300ms)
- Click feedback for interactive cards

### Form Interactions
**Guide users through forms:**
- Input focus states with border color change
- Floating labels that animate up
- Real-time validation with inline messages
- Success checkmarks for valid inputs
- Error states with shake animation
- Password strength indicators
- Character count for text areas

### Page Transitions
**Smooth between views:**
- Fade + slide for page changes
- Skeleton loaders during data fetch
- Optimistic UI updates
- Stagger animations for lists
- Route transition animations

---

## Mobile Responsiveness

### Mobile-First Approach
**Design for mobile, enhance for desktop:**
- Touch targets minimum 44x44px
- Generous padding and spacing
- Sticky bottom navigation on mobile
- Collapsible sections for long content
- Swipeable cards and galleries
- Pull-to-refresh where appropriate

### Responsive Patterns
**Adapt layouts intelligently:**
- Hamburger menu → full nav bar
- Card grid → stack on mobile
- Sidebar → drawer
- Multi-column → single column
- Data tables → card list
- Hide/show elements based on viewport

---

## Loading & Empty States

### Loading States
**Never leave users wondering:**
- Skeleton screens matching content layout
- Progress bars for known durations
- Animated placeholders
- Spinners only for short waits (<3s)
- Stagger loading for multiple elements
- Shimmer effects on skeletons

### Empty States
**Make empty states helpful:**
- Illustrations or icons
- Helpful copy explaining why it's empty
- Clear CTA to add first item
- Examples or suggestions
- No "no data" text alone

---

## Unique Elements to Stand Out

### Distinctive Features
**Add personality:**
- Custom cursor effects on landing pages
- Animated page numbers or section indicators
- Unusual hover effects (magnification, distortion)
- Custom scrollbars
- Glassmorphism for overlays
- Animated SVG icons
- Typewriter effects for hero text
- Confetti or celebration animations for actions

### Interactive Elements
**Engage users:**
- Drag-and-drop interfaces
- Sliders and range controls
- Toggle switches with animations
- Progress steps with animations
- Expandable/collapsible sections
- Tabs with slide indicators
- Image comparison sliders
- Interactive demos or playgrounds

---

## Consistency Rules

### Maintain Consistency
**What should stay consistent:**
- Spacing scale (4px, 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px, 48px, 64px)
- Border radius values
- Animation timing (200ms, 300ms, 500ms)
- Color system (primary, secondary, accent, neutrals)
- Typography scale
- Icon style (outline vs filled)
- Button styles across the app
- Form element styles

### What Can Vary
**Project-specific customization:**
- Color palette (different colors, same system)
- Layout creativity (grids, asymmetry)
- Illustration style
- Animation personality
- Feature-specific interactions
- Hero section design
- Card styling variations
- Background patterns or textures
